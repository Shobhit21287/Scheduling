# OSAss2
In question we make changes in linux/kernel/sys.c file and add a system call there
then we add the system call in syscalls_64.tbl file as well
after compiling it we have our own system call which we can use

To dispatch it as a patch we can use diff command to get the difference between two files and save it

this file can be used to patch a kernel
